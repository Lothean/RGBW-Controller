# RGBW-Controller
A simple (but not very well written) RGBW controller for Arduinos based around the ATmega 328P microcontroller

Very crude but working by now

Warning! This is the "untested" branch! This code is written by me but not tested yet, although there is more things, it might not work properly!

Please do not make pull requests for this branch, the code here may not be pushed to master. If you wrote code for this branch, wait and see if it gets pushed to master and then submit your pull request, thanks!

It requires the Arduino-IRremote library (https://github.com/z3t0/Arduino-IRremote)

Feel free to contribute!
