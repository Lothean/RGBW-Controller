# RGBW-Controller
A simple (but not very well written) RGBW controller for Arduino compatible boards based around the ATmega 328P microcontroller

Current state: Working! Basic functions available : Color Choice, White control, Crossfade between color, Auto fade with random colors, DIY colors. Requires the 44-key IR remote from RGB LED strips controllers, but you can change that.

It requires the Arduino-IRremote library (https://github.com/z3t0/Arduino-IRremote)

Feel free to contribute!
